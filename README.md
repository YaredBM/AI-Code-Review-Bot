# AI-Code-Review-Bot

An AI-powered GitHub bot that automatically reviews pull requests, detects issues, and suggests improvements using AI (GPT-4 or other LLMs). The bot integrates with GitHub Actions & Webhooks to analyze code changes and provide insightful feedback directly on PRs.

🚀 Features

✅ AI-Powered Code Review – Uses GPT-4 to analyze code changes and provide suggestions.
✅ GitHub Webhook Integration – Listens for PR events and processes code changes automatically.
✅ Multi-Language Support – Currently supports Python; can be extended to JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, etc.
✅ Security & Best Practices Checks – Uses AI to flag potential vulnerabilities and code smells.
✅ Customizable Rules – Users can define rules and AI-enhanced policies for code quality.
✅ GitHub Commenting – AI-generated feedback is automatically posted as a comment on the PR.
✅ Azure / Docker Deployment Ready – Easily deployable on cloud or as a self-hosted service.

📌 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

GitHub App Credentials (App ID, Private Key, Webhook Secret)

GitHub Personal Access Token (for API interactions)

OpenAI API Key (for AI-based reviews)

Python 3.8+ installed

pip (Python package manager)

Flask for the webhook server

🛠 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-code-review-bot.git
$ cd ai-code-review-bot

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Set Environment Variables

Create a .env file and add the following credentials:

GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_private_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

4️⃣ Run the Webhook Server

$ python app.py

This starts the server that listens for GitHub webhook events.

🔗 GitHub App Setup

Create a GitHub App:

Go to GitHub Developer Settings

Click New GitHub App

Set the webhook URL to http://yourserver.com/webhook

Grant Read & Write permissions for pull requests

Generate and save the private key

Install the GitHub App on your repositories

Configure Webhook Secret if needed

🚀 Deployment

🐳 Docker Deployment

Build Docker Image

$ docker build -t ai-code-review-bot .

Run the Container

$ docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env ai-code-review-bot

☁️ Deploy on Azure

Create an Azure App Service or Azure Functions

Set environment variables in Azure

Deploy the Flask app using GitHub Actions

🛠 How It Works

A Pull Request (PR) is created or updated.

The GitHub webhook sends an event to the AI bot.

The bot fetches the changed files and sends the code to OpenAI’s GPT API for analysis.

AI generates feedback and suggestions.

The bot posts comments directly on the PR.
